I'm glad you asked! Since this is more of a personal thing, please refrain
from sending pull requests with more things to add to the cheatsheet, or
more language files. Feel free to send bug fixes if you see me doing something
wrong or if the explanation (comments in the code) is wrong. Also comments on
how to improve this will be highly appreciated.

You are encouraged to fork it and making it your own, or to use the code
examples as you see fit.
